I'm a research intern at NYU Game Innovation Lab working with [Prof. Julian Togelius](http://julian.togelius.com/). Previously, I'm a master student at NYU. My main research interest is learning general states that enables faster learning by providing intrinsic rewards based on the states and generalization to similar but unseen environments. You can check my [CV](/files/CV.pdf) and [Resume](/files/Resume.pdf)
